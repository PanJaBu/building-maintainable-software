## Topics

* What's maintainable software
* Why
* Object Calisthenics
* Value Objects

# Maintainable software?

Maintainable software allows __us__ to __quickly__:

* Fix a bug
* Add new features
* Improve usability
* Increase performance
* Make a fix that prevents a bug from occurring in future

---

# Why

* Strong timeframes
* Developers leaving teams
* You read more then you code

---

> You need to write code that minimizes the time it would take someone els to understand it.
> Event if that someone is you.

# Object calisthenics

* Programming exercises
* 9 Rules

* Guidelines, not rules
* I don't always follow them myself

---

# 1. Only one indentation level per method

* Single responsibility principle
* reusable code

---

# 2. Don't use the else keyword

* Readability
* Less cyclomatic complexity
* Less duplication

---

# 3. Wrap all primitives and strings

* Type hinting
* Encapsulation
* Enforcing a contract

---

# 4. First class collection

* Cleaner code
* Easier to merge collections

---

# 5. One dot per line

* Easier to debug
* Readability

---

# 6. Don't abbreviate

* Readability

---

# 7. Keep all classes small

* Single responsibility principle
* Clear objective and methods

---

# 8. No classes with more than five instance variables

* Easier to mock in unit tests
* Shorter dependency list

---

# 9. No getters/setters
